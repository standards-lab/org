-- The hold of a file row for the rest of the caller's transaction: the
-- reference-then-delete rule's first half. The update assigns updated_at
-- to itself, so it changes no value and advances no version, and it
-- takes the row's lock, which holds until the transaction ends. A
-- file-delete begin that runs meanwhile waits on that lock and, once the
-- caller's row that references the file has committed, reads it. A row
-- that is deleting matches nothing, so the caller refuses to reference a
-- file whose delete has begun; the caller reads the row back to tell that
-- from a row that does not exist. A transaction is required because a
-- lock autocommit releases at once holds nothing.
