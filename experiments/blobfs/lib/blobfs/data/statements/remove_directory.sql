-- Removes one non-root directory. The root is refused in Go before this
-- runs, and the parent_id predicate keeps the statement itself from ever
-- removing it, so no statement of the library can remove the root. A
-- directory that still has child directories fails the foreign key
-- blobfs_fk_directory_parent and one that still has files
-- blobfs_fk_file_directory, which the delete mapping reports as
-- ErrNotEmpty; there is no cascade. A consumer's foreign key into
-- blobfs_directory refuses the removal as ErrReferenced. No row affected
-- means the directory does not exist. One statement, so it accepts the
-- pool and composes into a caller's transaction alike.
DELETE FROM blobfs_directory
WHERE id = {{id:uuid}} AND parent_id IS NOT NULL
