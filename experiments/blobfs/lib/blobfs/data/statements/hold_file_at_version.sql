-- The hold of a file row at the version the caller read, for a caller
-- that acts on a listing without reading the row again: hold_file with
-- the version in the predicate. As there, the update changes no value and
-- advances no version, so other holders of the version stay valid, and
-- the row's lock holds until the transaction ends. A row at another
-- version, or one that is deleting, matches nothing; the caller reads the
-- row back to tell the two from a row that does not exist.
