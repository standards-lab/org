-- The last step of a directory move, as the guarded command of the query
-- library's optimistic-concurrency protocol: sets the directory's parent
-- and name, advances the version, and stamps updated_at. The guard's
-- predicate names the id and the version the caller read. The parent_id
-- predicate keeps the statement from ever moving the root, which Go
-- refuses before this runs. It requires a transaction because it is the
-- third of three statements that must see one tree lock: the lock, the
-- cycle check, and this update, in that order, so a concurrent move
-- cannot pass its own check between this transaction's check and its
-- update. A new parent that does not exist fails the foreign key
-- blobfs_fk_directory_parent, and a name already held under the new
-- parent the unique constraint blobfs_uq_directory_parent_name.
