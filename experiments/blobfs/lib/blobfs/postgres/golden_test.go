// a changed row is a breaking change to the schema's version line. Nothing
// is released yet, so the directory migration was amended in place for the
// root named / and the created_at index migration was removed, and the
// hashes were re-pinned; an installed database is reset before this set
// runs over it. The upgrade rehearsal, a version applied over an installed
// schema, runs in the migrator's tests over a fixture migration of their
// own.
