--| native: a text[] parameter indexed by the recursion depth inside WITH RECURSIVE, so a path of any depth resolves in one round trip where the baseline reads one child per segment. Port: an engine must bind an ordered list as one parameter and index it by position inside a recursive query (SQL Server's OPENJSON WITH ORDINALITY over a JSON array, Oracle's JSON_TABLE, SQLite's json_each with its key), and its driver must encode a Go []string as that parameter; an engine without one keeps the baseline's walk.
-- Path resolution in one statement: the deepest directory reached below
-- start_id along segments, a text[] of normalized directory names in
-- path order, with its depth. The anchor is the start itself at depth 0,
-- and each step joins the child of the last row whose name is the
-- segment at the next depth, so the walk stops by itself at the first
-- segment that names no directory. The final SELECT keeps the row at the
-- greatest depth: a depth equal to the number of segments is the resolved
-- directory, a smaller depth names the last directory reached and so the
-- segment that failed, and no row at all means the start does not
-- exist. The variant returns the row and its depth; the store spells the
-- failing prefix from the segments it holds. No segments returns the
-- start at depth 0, since an empty array has no element at position 1.
-- The segments bind as one parameter, so a name is never spliced into
-- the text, whatever characters it carries. The row is selected by the
-- maximum depth rather than sorted and cut, which the measurement showed
-- costs three buffers on a sort the walk does not need.
